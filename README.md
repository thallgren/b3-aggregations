# Eclipse Simrel mirroring

This repository contains b3 aggregation specs suitable for mirroring
the eclipse simultanious release. Please note that this has nothing
to do with the actual building of the release. The intention is
instead to provide aggregations that can be used when creating
stripped down mirrors of the release.

## How to use

You will of course need the b3 aggregator in order to use these
aggregations.
